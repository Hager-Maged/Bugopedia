## Project Overview

Bugopedia is an interactive platform that collects all kinds of errors and bugs developers might face — whether from code, OS issues, or other technical problems. It helps developers search for specific errors, understand why and how they happened, and find clear solutions to fix or avoid them in the future.
Each error includes a simple visualization showing how it occurred, along with a comment section where developers can share their fixes or tips. If a developer faces a new bug not listed, they can submit it with a description of their experience to help others.
To boost community engagement, users earn points by adding bugs, commenting, or contributing in any way. These points unlock badges, exclusive tools, and special features — rewarding active users and encouraging collaboration.


## Project Objectives 

The primary objective of Bugopedia is to streamline the debugging process for developers by creating a centralized, community-driven platform that provides clear, visual explanations for a wide range of software bugs and errors. The platform aims to:

• Reduce the time and effort developers spend searching for solutions to common and uncommon errors.

• Foster a collaborative environment where developers can share real-world experiences, solutions, and insights.

• Enhance understanding of how and why specific bugs occur through interactive visualizations.

• Promote continuous learning and engagement through gamified features like points and badges.

• Build a reliable, user-generated knowledge base that evolves with the tech community.


## Project Scope

Bugopedia is an interactive web platform aimed at streamlining the debugging process for developers. The scope of this project includes:

• Curating a comprehensive and categorized database of common programming errors and system bugs across various technologies.

• Providing simplified explanations, root cause analysis, and visual breakdowns of how each error occurs and can be resolved.

• Enabling developers to submit new bugs and errors not listed on the platform, sharing their personal experiences and solutions.

• Supporting community-driven knowledge sharing through comments, discussions, and alternative solutions.

• Implementing a gamified points and rewards system to encourage user engagement, with badges, leaderboards, and access to exclusive features.


## Project Plan

The project will be executed over a period of 10 weeks, starting from 24/09/2025 and concluding on 28/11/2025
Timeline & Milestones

• Week 1 (Sep 24–30): Define core features, design UI wireframes, and set up GitHub workflow. Start React project and prepare mock data (JSON files or dummy APIs).

• Weeks 2–3 (Oct 1–13): Frontend team builds main pages (Home with search/categories, Bug Details with visualization placeholder + comments, Submit Bug form, User Profile with points/badges). Focus on styling and user flow. Backend team starts setting up Node.js, Express, and MongoDB schemas in the background.

• Weeks 4–5 (Oct 14–27): Backend develops APIs (auth, bugs, comments, points). Meanwhile, frontend continues polishing UI and ensuring responsiveness. Towards the end of week 5, start connecting real APIs instead of mock data.

• Week 6 (Oct 28–Nov 3): Integrate frontend with backend completely. Add visualizations (Mermaid.js, D3.js, or simple diagrams) into bug details page.

• Week 7 (Nov 4–10): Implement gamification: frontend builds leaderboard, badges, and points UI; backend adds logic for points and badge assignment.

• Week 8 (Nov 11–17): Testing and debugging: verify all flows (add bug, comment, earn points, see badges). Improve UX/UI design and handle edge cases.

• Week 9 (Nov 18–24): Final refinements, prepare presentation/demo, and deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify), backend (Render/Heroku), and database (MongoDB Atlas).
